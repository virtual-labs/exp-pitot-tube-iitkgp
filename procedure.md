## Procedure

Detail procedure for conducting this experiment is given below.

1. Diameter of the duct is measured by measuring tape or scale.
2. The measuring distance from the walls for the respective measuring points are marked on the Pitot static tube.
3. Pitot tube is placed at respective location.
4. Two ends of DPCal are attached to the static pressure and total pressure end of the Pitot tube.
5. Velocity pressure is noted at the particular location.
6. The process is repeated to measure the velocity for all the measuring points.
7. Average velocity is calculated and the velocity profile is drawn using these data.

The experimental might be tabulated as the given table1 below.
